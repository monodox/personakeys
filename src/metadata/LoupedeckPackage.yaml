  Hardware-native AI command surface for developers with 4 specialized coding assistants.
  Supports on-device inference via Ollama (llama3.2:latest) for private, low-latency AI actions.
  
  Features:
  - 4 Developer Personas: Debugger, Refactorer, Documenter, Architect
  - Physical strictness control via Actions Ring (multi-parameter modulation)
  - Haptic feedback for every interaction
  - Clipboard workflow with no UI interruption
  - Multi-provider support: Ollama (local), OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Anthropic Claude
  
  Ring Control (Signature Feature):
  - 0-20: Strict mode (deterministic, proven solutions)
  - 20-40: Conservative (safe, incremental changes)
  - 40-60: Balanced (pragmatic mix)
  - 60-80: Creative (modern patterns)
  - 80-100: Experimental (novel solutions, structural rewrites)
  
  Ring position adjusts temperature, top_p, and repeat_penalty in real-time for device-native AI control.
